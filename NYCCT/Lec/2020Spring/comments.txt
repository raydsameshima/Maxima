1)

Not a few students use the following discussion:
  [L/T] * [T^(-1)] =? [L]
but, [T^(-1)] stands for [1/T] and the above right hand side becomes
  [L/T^2]
which, of course, is not [L].
You can consult any material, but you have to check the logical flow.

The coefficient (a pre factor) of x_a is not sqrt(k/m), but sqrt(m/k).

All questions in (1) must be on both cases.
Many students do not consider one, and lose pts.

Total mechanical energy must have the same unit of KE and PE.
Therefore
  m*(v_0)^2/2
  k*(x_0)^2/2
are fine.
(m*(x_0)^2 or k*(v_0)^2 have wrong unit for being energy, for example.)
You must check the unit after you obtain the result, in particular, the coefficients for cosine and sine must be the same.

The minus sign in the self-inductance is important.
You must remember Lenz's law, see eq.(23.36) and the following discussion:
  https://openstax.org/books/college-physics/pages/23-9-inductance
If you omit the very negative sign, the corresponding DE becomes different one, hence the solutions are not, too.
They are, indeed, divergent/decaying solutions, and never osculate.

Once you see the pattern:
  m ~ L
  k ~ 1/C
what is the corresponding period for LC circuit, if the period of the mechanical oscillator is
  2*pi*sqrt(m/k)

3)

Depending upon which convention you use, namely
  1/di +(-)1/do
for the lens equation, you must follow the same notion.
(This difference comes from whether coordinates(displacements) or distances(absolute values).)
Do not mix these two conventions:
  1/di - 1/do
    and
  do=+9[cm], di=7[cm]
(If you write negative nine centimeter, it is completely fine.)

If you are to write
  1/fa = 1/9 + 1/7 = 16/63 =? 3.9375[cm]
this is clearly wrong, isn't it?
You must show what you did (want to do), how you did, and the outcome(s), clearly and step-by-step.
(From the above example, once you write
  1/fa = 16/63
then flipping num/den, write your final answer as:
  fa = 63/16 = ...)

You may use the previous results to proceed, but you need to take more digits than the final result(s), otherwise, you loose significant figures.
Another option is to use rational numbers.

4)

You can read our lab manual (of our first source) to find the formula, the work done by current in eq.(3), page 59.
You can also convince yourself by counting the unit of your expression, if you write I*R^2*t.
Does this expression have [J] as its unit?
Check it (or simply open the page 59).

5)

Why did you leave
  9/15 * R
without canceling the common factor 3 to write it as
  3/5 * R ?

Without knowing R3, you can not estimate
  1/R3 - 1/R2.


6)

If you need such a high accurate computation, you have to use rational numbers, otherwise you must be extremely careful on the significant figures.

For example, the 14th stage of the rocket has
  178436520564140/201313313019101
of speed of light, check your calculation.

The last two questions use the stages OPPOSITELY, i.e., the system is de-accelerating.
Within 5-percent of speed of light means 
  -0.05*c<x<0.05*c
